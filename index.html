						<h3>Why Hawaii?</h3>
						<h2>Islands of Aloha</h2>
						<p>
							Why is Hawaii so popular? Well, if you believe the famous American
							author, Mark Twain, you should. He referred to the Hawaiian
							Islands as “the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in
							any ocean.” And many who make the same journey to the Aloha State
							will often agree. But the uniqueness of Hawaii makes it a place
							where many visitors will always want to return. Below are some of
							the many reasons why you should visit Hawaii, the Aloha State.
